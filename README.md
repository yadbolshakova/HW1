# HW1
the first homework
## **Short story about myself**
*Let me start introducing myself with the fact that I don't really like describing my personality, since I find it quite silly when people are talking about themselves, you know, it's like some "aftter summer" paperwork in the 6th grade. Well, I suppose that you have already got my attitude towards this kind of homework, but, anyway, I'm very responsible person, so here you are.*

Enough with the introduction, let's come to the real facts
- being tiny
  - If you are too lucky, life will give you an opportunity to get along with 160 centimeters of the true brightness and intelegence.
- ~~being quite shy~~
  - Just kidding, lol.
- **01.01.17** is a special day for me
   - On that day I got an iron grip on a person who is sitting beside and helping me with the homework
- pug lover
   - these cuties just drive me crazy sometimes 
- going to gym 
   - Nike sweatpants is such a thing which is worth exercising as hard as I can, but unfortunately the university timetable doesn't share my obsession with the sweatpants. I mean... Oh, just have a look)

- food is my passion
   - I like cooking a lot, so I'll just leave a link on my [instapage](https://www.instagram.com/yn_bolshakova/) where I share some recipes with my subscribers. 

**That's all for now, folks!**
